# *Quality Attributes*

The Novelty team decided that the quality attributes that heavily represents the company and bookstore are performance, modifiability, and availability. Performance was noted to be one of the heavy-implemented quality attributes, as the performance aspects - minimum to no website downtime, increased amount of data storage, etc. are very crucial aspects considering that Novelty is a virtual bookstore, hence the site must have performance-oriented implementation. As per iteration 1, each quality attribute is assigned to a separate use case as in the table.
