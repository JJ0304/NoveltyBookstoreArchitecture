# *Iteration 1: Architecture Design Process*

Novelty (Online Bookstore System)

<p>Step 1: Review Inputs</p>
<p>Step 2: Establish iteration goal and select inputs to be considered in the iteration</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the system to decompose</p>
<p>Step 4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the inputs considered in the iteration</p>
<p>Step 5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities, and define interfaces</p>
<p>Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions</p>
<p>Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review interaction goal and design objectives</p>

# *Selection of Design Concepts*

> Novelty design concept follows reference architecture because this design concept provides a blueprint for structuring an application; which includes web applications, mobile applications, rich client applications, rich internet applications, and service applications. There are many important components that are present in the reference architecture. Some of the major components are the browser, the user interface, and the business logic. The web browser is the application that is running on the client machine. The user interface is responsible for presenting information to the users and receiving user interactions. The UI process logic is responsible for managing the control flow of the applicationâ€™s use cases.
