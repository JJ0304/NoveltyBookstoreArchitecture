# *System Constraints*

The system constraints for Novelty Bookstore are the set of conditions and aspects that need to be in place for the most efficient and effective running of the company. There are six constraints that the Novelty team has aligned for Iteration 1, and they all generalized, and must-have constraints in order to get the most out of the site. This will also help users get the most out of Novelty.
