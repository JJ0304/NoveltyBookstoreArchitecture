# *Analysis*

Like every procedure, there needs to be a step where analysis should take place in order to review the process to improve the system. The Novelty team decided to create a kanban board that would showcase the steps and changes taking place during each iteration. In iteration 1, the Novelty team layed out all the use cases, quality attributes, and system constraints that are responsible for structuring the system. Most of the components were not addressed since iteration 1 is the beginning stage. The components that were partially addressed or even fully addressed were the ones that fit the criteria of structuring the system. For instance, use cases 1 - 4 were all fully addressed since they were the first part of building up the application. The user registration and login system would structure the overall aspect of the application. It would allow users to become customers and purchase or rent out books. The kanban board would change in the upcoming iterations based on the decisions of the Novelty team.
