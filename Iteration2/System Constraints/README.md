# *System Constraints*

As part of iteration 2, the system constraints are the same as iteration 1. The same expectations are seen for Novelty Bookstore, and the same procedures to put in order to ensure maximum functionality. There are six constraints, for example the chot box being available 24/6 in case it is needed. The constraints listed help make Novelty Bookstore not only an efficient site, but also safe and user-friendly.
