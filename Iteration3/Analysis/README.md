# *Analysis*

The analysis of iteration 2 followed the same procedure of iteration 1. The Novelty team used a kanban board to track the progress of changes based on use cases, quality attributes, and system constraints. Compared to iteration 1, in iteration 2 the Novelty team moved many components from not addressed to partially or fully addressed, since functionality is an important aspect to the team. The components in pink are the changes that have been made in iteration 2 focusing on the iteration goal which consists of the functionality of the system.
