# *Analysis*

The overall progress analysis of Iteration 3 was quite similar to procedures followed in both iterations 1 and 2, however the focused was placed on implementing the features required to create a functioning prototype of the Novelty system, acting as the most primitive but functional version of Novelty. The kanban board (chart that tracks progress of implemented constraints, use cases, and quality attributes) experienced significants updates in iteration 3, finally addressing all vital parts of the system in some capacity. Some features are not complete in this iteration however, mainly concerning the payment system such as the feature to charge credit cards. The components highlighted in green are the changes made in progression from iteration 2 to 3, placing focus on developing the most complete and functional version of novelty on both the areas of front end and backend architecture.
