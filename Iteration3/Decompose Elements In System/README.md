# *Decompose Elements In System*

When decomposing elements for iteration 2, the Novelty team focused on the backend of the architecture. This included the database and the logic to function the application. The top-down approach in iteration 2 starts with the Novelty Database and seperates into 4 different sections which build up the key features of the application. For instance, book orders, inventory, customer feedback, and customer information. All of these components must be functional in order for the whole system to work.
