# *Selection of Design Concepts*

The overall selection of design concepts for interation 3 are the most well rounded compared to previous iterations. For iteration 3, the Novelty team focused on program performance, as such, extra steps were taken in order to fulfil the quality attribute scenarios, complete modules of the frontend, and implementing new architectural elements. Within the first table, the team's design decisions consisted primarily of database (backend) updated frontend systems, being the User registration/login system, site browsing system, and the payment system. The frontend was devloped using ReactJS as the team was most comfortable with using that development platform for both visually and functionally constructing the frontned. The second table is made up of the logical views of the system such as Reusable components, high performance, and partitioning. Each of these elements are responsible for accomplishing specific tasks on the frontend of the website, ensuring smoother function and minimizing errors.
