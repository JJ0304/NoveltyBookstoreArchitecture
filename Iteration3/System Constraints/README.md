# *System Constraints*

The system constraints are the same as in the previous iterations. The system constraints at this stage are confirmed and the Novelty development team has decided that with these system constraints, the Novelty virtual library site will work at its finest, with minimum to no difficulties. These constraints will be very effective in any situation that the team has to face whether it is with the site itself, or any situations that individuals are discovering on the site.
